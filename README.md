# Project Environment
SpaceX stands out as a trailblazer in the realm of commercial space endeavors, having achieved remarkable success in revolutionizing space travel by rendering it more financially viable. Central to this accomplishment is their prowess in redefining the economics of spaceflight. Their website prominently showcases Falcon 9 rocket launches, an innovation exemplified by a price tag of $62 million. In stark contrast, other spaceflight providers demand a staggering $165 million or more for each launch. The stark disparity in costs can be largely attributed to SpaceX's pioneering approach of recycling the initial stage of their rockets.<br>
The ingenious strategy of reusability is at the heart of SpaceX's financial ingenuity. By recovering and refurbishing the primary stage of their rockets, SpaceX has managed to significantly trim expenses, making space travel a more affordable proposition than ever before. This novel practice not only minimizes the wastage of resources but also contributes substantially to the cost-effectiveness of their operations.<br>
The focal point of our endeavor revolves around predicting a pivotal aspect of this reusability equation: the successful landing of the first rocket stage. This predictive venture is rooted in the correlation between the success of the landing and the subsequent reusability of the stage, which in turn impacts the overall cost of a launch. Drawing upon publicly available information and harnessing the power of machine learning models, we aim to discern patterns and factors that influence the first stage's chances of a successful landing.<br>
Through this predictive undertaking, we aspire to gain insights that extend beyond mere speculation. By leveraging machine learning, we intend to decipher the complex interplay of variables that can foretell whether SpaceX will be able to reutilize the primary stage of their rockets. This, in turn, would enable us to deduce the prospective cost of a launch, making this predictive pursuit not only a technical feat but also an economically impactful endeavor.<br>
In essence, our project endeavors to harness the capabilities of data analysis and machine learning to delve into the future potential of reusing the first stage of SpaceX's rockets. The ramifications of our predictive model extend beyond theoretical curiosity, potentially offering valuable insights that could contribute to the overarching financial viability of space exploration, and by extension, the future of commercial space travel.

## :page_facing_up: Project Background
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space 
age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 
9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; 
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the 
savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we 
can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost 
of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning 
models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
