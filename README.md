# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
Capstone project, which serves as the concluding and tenth course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. This final project is designed to consolidate and showcase all the knowledge and skills I have acquired throughout the entire specialization.<br> 
The primary objective of this Capstone project is to encapsulate the breadth and depth of my learning journey by integrating the various concepts, techniques, and methodologies covered in the previous nine courses. It provides a comprehensive overview of data science principles, data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization that I have been exposed to.<br>Through this project, I am expected to address a real-world problem or scenario using the skills I've gained. This involves not only applying data collection, cleaning, analysis, and modeling techniques but also effectively communicating my findings and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.<br> By synthesizing the learned material into a practical project, I can effectively demonstrate my ability to tackle complex data-driven challenges. This Capstone project acts as a testament to my proficiency in data science and serves as a significant addition to my portfolio, showcasing my readiness to contribute effectively in a professional data science role.
